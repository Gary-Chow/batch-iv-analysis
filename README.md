=================

GUI python program to do batch curve fitting on data files generated by the McGehee LabVIEW IV measurement tool. The algorithm here attempts to fit IV data points to the characteristic equation of a solar cell:

### Files here
---
- batch-iv-analysis.py
 - Main python script, edit this directly
- batch-iv-analysis.ui
 - Contains user interface design, edit with Qt Designer (I used version 4.8.5)
- batch_iv_analysis_UI.py
 - Do not edit this file directly. Instead generate it from batch-iv-analysis.ui by issuing `pyuic4 batch-iv-analysis.ui > batch_iv_analysis_UI.py`

### How to use
---
- Start the program with `python batch-iv-analysis.py`  
- Open the files for analysis with File --> Open (can select multiple files here)  
- Double click on any line in the table to bring up a graph to compare the fitted curve with the raw data
