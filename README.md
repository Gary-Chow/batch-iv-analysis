batch-iv-analysis
=================

GUI python program to do batch curve fitting on data files generated by the McGehee lab view IV measurement tool

### Files here

- batch-iv-analysis.py
 - Main python script, edit this directly
- batch-iv-analysis.ui
 - Contains user interface design, edit with QTDesigner (I used version 4.8.5)
- batch_iv_analysis_UI.py
- Do not edit this directly. Instead generate it from batch-iv-analysis.ui by issuing `pyuic4 batch-iv-analysis.ui > batch_iv_analysis_UI.py`
