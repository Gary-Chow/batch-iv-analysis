batch-iv-analysis
=================

This project is a GUI program written in python, intended to make it easy for solar cell researchers to characterize the electrical properties of the solar cells they make. The code here takes IV (current-voltage sweep) data files (of various formats, new format additions welcome!) and uses it to find values for the components of the following solar cell circuit model:

where `R_S` is the series resistance  
`R_SH` is the shunt resistance,  
`I_D` is the diode current,  
`I_L` is the light current,  
`I` is the current out of the positive terminal of the cell (given)  
and `V` is the voltage across the cell (given)  
which is described by

`I_L`, `I_0`, `n`, `R_S` and `R_SH` are found by [nonlinear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_regression) via [`scipy.optimize.curve_fit()`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.17.0/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.curve_fit.html).

I'd be super happy to accept pull requests or ideas you have for improving this!

### How to use
---
- Start the program with `python batch-iv-analysis.py` if you have python and all of the required packages installed
 - If you're running windows and you don't have python installed, you can try running batch-iv-analysis.exe in the exe zip from [the latest release](https://github.com/spraycoater/batch-iv-analysis/releases/latest/) (note that I create a new release whenever I feel like it and so using a release package typically means you're not running the latest code)
- Open the files for analysis with File --> Open (can select multiple files here)
 - A working example of the format of an input file is exampleData.csv, you can open that file to check that everything is working properly. All non-data rows in a valid input file must be preceded with #

### Features
---
- Hover over the column headers for a little blurb on what that column contains
- Double click anywhere in the table to bring up a graph to compare the fitted curve with the raw data associated with the line you clicked (this is a way to quickly check if the fit is good or bad)
 - This feature seems to crash under windows if you do this without closing a previously opened graph window
- Hover over the file name in each column to see the LabVIEW generated summary data for that file (for comparison purposes)
- The numbers shown in the table for Pmax, Vmax, Voc, I/Jsc and FF are calculated from a spline fit to the data.
 - Hovering over these values will show those calculated from the fit to the characteristic solar cell equation 
 - Hovering over other numbers in the table will show +/- 95% confidence intervals for that value
- Can read and plot i,v vs time data files generated by i-v-vs-time-taker. Does no analysis on them currently (but could in the future).

### Files here
---
- **batch-iv-analysis.py**
 - Main python script. Run this to use the tool. You can edit the code in this file directly using your favorite editor.
- **batch-iv-analysis.ui**
 - Contains user interface design for main window, edit with Qt Designer (I used version 4.8.5)
- **batch_iv_analysis_UI.py**
 - Do not edit this file directly. Instead generate it from batch-iv-analysis.ui by issuing:  
`pyuic4 -o batch_iv_analysis_UI.py batch-iv-analysis.ui`
- **interpolate.py**
 - Borrowed [from here](http://pywafo.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pywafo/src/wafo/interpolate.py) this is needed for SmoothingSpline
- **polynomial.py**
 - Borrowed [from here](http://pywafo.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pywafo/src/wafo/polynomial.py) this is needed for SmoothingSpline
- **setup.py**
 - Use this file to generate standalone release packages (see instructions below)

### How to generate a standalone release package (for windows/OSX)
---
To generate an install package for a specific platform (windows or OSX) you must do these steps on that platform. This has only been tested under windows but should also work for macs. There is no need to generate a release package for Linux, just run the script directly.
- Install python and all the packages this project depends on
 - Make sure you can run the program directly with `python batch-iv-analysis.py` before proceeding
- Install cx_freeze
- run `python setup.py build`
 - If you see an issue with exec_py3...something you can safely delete this file to solve the problem
- The standalone release files will be in a newly created folder called build
 - These files can then be copied to another computer to run the tool there
- It's also possible to generate installers with `setup.py`, see the cx_Freeze docs for more info  

__NOTE:__ To get Umfpack to work in windows, you might have to look [here](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) for a precompiled pip wheel package to install.

### Python packages required
---
I can't remember. Here are some:
- mpmath.libmp  
- gmpy
- scipy
- sympy

To install these requirements under Debian/Ubuntu (tested under Ubuntu 15.10) do this:  
```
sudo apt-get install python2.7 python-mpmath python-gmpy python-sympy python-scipy python-numpy libsuitesparse-dev python-pip libopenblas-dev swig
sudo pip install scikit-umfpack
```
To install these requirements in Arch Linux, do this:  
```
pacaur --needed -S python2 python2-mpmath python2-gmpy2 python2-sympy python2-scipy python2-pyqt4 python-pyqt4 python2-scikit-umfpack
```
